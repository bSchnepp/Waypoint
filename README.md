# Waypoint
A free, high performance operating system for modern computers.

## What is Waypoint?
Waypoint is the "native part" of Feral, in that it is what the Feral kernel
is designed for. It is an in-progress operating system intended to be used
primarilly by applications seeking high performance, low input latency,
and high throughput workloads.
In particular, Waypoint is designed with the intent of being the best gaming
platform to have ever existed.

Waypoint does this by having a rich and verbose API where applications
clearly express their intent, what devices need to be used, and an assortment
of other details to provide as much information as possible to the underlying
system, helping to boost performance and otherwise benefit performance somehow.

## License?
Feral itself is under the Boost Software License, version 1. See it's repository for details.
Various components of Waypoint may be under differing licenses, so please
inspect each source code file manually for details.

(for now, it's just Feral, but we *may* need something like native port of gcc in the future here...)
